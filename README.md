# Getting and Cleaning Data by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera
## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is [Getting and Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/) course project. In this project, I solved five problems below:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

All problems are provided in order to prepare tidy dataset which can be used for later analysis.

For later analysis, I will apply a classification algorithm to predict the dependent variable `activity`.
